# Patternless Optimisms

This is a different approach to a project that; at least I have seen. It is an attempt to challenge the status quo, adopting only the bare essentials necessary, including new contructs and documenting, in plain english, the *why* and best *how* only as the need arises. This may seem like a no brainer; however, in the complexity of modern development, this approach has fallen by the wayside in lieu of "one size fits all" solutions and frameworks all with varying patterns and constructs to follow... Should those be misinterpereted or forgotten, because lets be honest and call it what it is, an overwhelming number of "best practices" to remember and follow. These practices have  been lost in translation, most implementing them without knowing the *why* and choosing the highest ranked *how* instead of working through the possible solutions and implementing the best approach for the project's need. This is a culprit of overzealous timelines and excessive demand to hasten delivery. I intend this project to encapsulate the reasons behind all implementation techniques in a story-like format to showcase an enterprise style design system and component libary that simply does what it is intended to do.
